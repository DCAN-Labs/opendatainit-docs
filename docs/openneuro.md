# Integration With OpenNeuro

BOBSRepository on OpenNeuro: https://openneuro.org/datasets/ds005450

## Configure credentials

- Generate API here after logging into your account
- Run `deno run -A jsr:@openneuro/cli login to configure credentials`. This prompts you for the required configuration fields and these are saved in Denoâ€™s local storage. Choose openneuro instance when uploading to public data repo hosted on OpenNeuro

OR specify as environment variable:

```
export OPENNEURO_API_KEY=<api_key>
deno run -A jsr:@openneuro/cli login --error-reporting true
```

## Add OpenNeuro as a GitHub Sibling
Setting up OpenNeuro as a special remote is not necessary, instead you can push changes via git:

```bash
$ datalad siblings add --url https://openneuro.org/git/0/ds005450
[INFO   ] Could not annex-enable openneuro.org:   
  Remote openneuro.org not usable by git-annex; setting annex-ignore
  https://openneuro.org/git/0/ds005450/config download failed: Not Found
 
.: openneuro.org(-) [https://openneuro.org/git/0/ds005450 (git)]
```
Note that you may see the messages like the ones displayed above. The first (`Remote openneuro.org not usable by git-annex; setting annex-ignore`) simply indicates that the GitHub repository does not actually contain the annexed files themselves, but rather symlinks to the data files stored in local DataLad repository - this is expected behavior. The second ()`https://openneuro.org/git/0/ds005450/config download failed: Not Found`) indicates that the remote repository is lacking a config file, which is okay. As long as there are no error messages, then it should have worked.

## Push Changes to OpenNeuro Repository
Finally, to push changes to OpenNeuro:
```bash
$ datalad push --to openneuro.org --data nothing
```
