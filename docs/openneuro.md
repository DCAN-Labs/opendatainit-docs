# Step 4: Integration With OpenNeuro

BOBSRepository on OpenNeuro: https://openneuro.org/datasets/ds005450

## Configure credentials

- Generate API here after logging into your account
- Run `deno run -A jsr:@openneuro/cli login to configure credentials`. This prompts you for the required configuration fields and these are saved in Denoâ€™s local storage. Choose openneuro instance when uploading to public data repo hosted on OpenNeuro

OR specify as environment variable:

```
export OPENNEURO_API_KEY=<api_key>
deno run -A jsr:@openneuro/cli login --error-reporting true
```


## Push Changes to OpenNeuro Repository

Setting up OpenNeuro as a special remote is not necessary, instead you can push changes via git:

```bash
$ datalad siblings add --url https://openneuro.org/git/0/ds005450
