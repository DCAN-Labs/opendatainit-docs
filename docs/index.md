### About
The Baby Open Brains Repository, or BOBs Repository, is an open source resource of infant brain segmentations. We encourage new additions and changes to this open source repository, enabling a community-driven resource that will improve over time and extend into new ages and protocols. Please see [Feczko & Stoyell et al., 2024](https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.10.02.616147) published on bioRxiv for more information.

### Motivation
Reproducibility of neuroimaging research on infant brain development remains limited. One of the limitations on reproducibility is the variation in tissue segmentation atlases. Accurate cortical and subcortical segmentation are complicated due to dynamic growth processes in the first year of life and thus, an atlas is needed that supports the dynamic changes within this time period. Yet the availability of manually-corrected segmentations from anatomical MRI data across infancy is limited. This repository aims to provide a benchmark for evaluating and improving pipelines dependent upon segmentations in the youngest populations. This repository provides a vitally needed foundation for early-life large-scale studies and reproducible research broadly.

### How can I get involved?
We encourage everyone interested to take part in the open repository! Here are some ways:

* Use the segmentations as templates for MRI processing or processing pipeline development
* Review the existing segmentations for accuracy
* Contribute new segmentations from the existing data
* Contribute new data to the repository
